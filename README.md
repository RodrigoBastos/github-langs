## 2018!

I had some great ideas to improve this project! Unfortunately I don't have any much time to contribute it by myself, so I'm inviting you guys (existing contributors) and any open-source enthusiast :) Firstly, you could check on the **TODO LIST** to see the roadmap's checklist or you also can create your own issue to improve this project. Thank you and I'm waiting for your contributions!

## What ?

> Useful web checker to see what languages are used from a github account.

[Go to the web!](https://github-langs.herokuapp.com)

## Why ?

Let everyone know their languages statistic on github repo.

## Running the app locally

* [Generate a GitHub OAuth client id and client secret](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) to ensure you don't get rate limited API call.
* Create `.env` file with this content :

```
CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
ENV=local
```

* Install dependency : `npm install`
* Start the app `npm start` and go to : `http://localhost:5000`

## Running app through Docker

* Build image : `docker build -t local/github-langs .`
* Run image : ```docker run -v `pwd`/tests/screenshot-testing/screenshots:/app/tests/screenshot-testing/screenshots -v `pwd`/views:/app/views -v `pwd`/lib:/app/lib -it -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env local/github-langs```
* Start server in appeared terminal : `npm start`
* App is now available on `http://localhost:5000`

## Testing app through Docker

* Build image : `docker build -t local/github-langs .`
* Run image : ```docker run -v `pwd`/tests/screenshot-testing/screenshots:/app/tests/screenshot-testing/screenshots -v `pwd`/views:/app/views -v `pwd`/lib:/app/lib -it -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env local/github-langs```
* Redirect display output to xvfb : `source start-xvfb.sh`
* Execute tests : `npm test`
